  <div class="card response" id="1"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q1"><h2 class="heading">How did you get started in design?</h2></a>
      <p>I think I've learned that even if I wasn't aware there was a throughline in my practice, as you continue to make things, connections and associations emerge. When I was working at 2x4 in San Francisco / NYC, I was also working on my personal projects about online collections and workshops for handmade websites. This practice eventually became more charged as I began to think about the politics of collections, histories, and archives.</p>

  <div class="card response" id="2"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q2"><h2 class="heading">How did you get started with interactive design?</h2></a>
      <p>I would credit this to my former mentor Casey Reas at UCLA. I was introduced to Processing as a Sophomore, but I was very intimidated by code until I reached by Senior year, where I made a print-on-demand software to produce thesis catalogs, thanks so much to Jürg Lehni and Tyler Stefanich!</p>

  <div class="card response" id="3"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q3"><h2 class="heading">Can you describe a recent project you’ve worked on that relates to interaction design?</h2></a>
      <p>I recently made the <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/">Cyberfeminism Index</a> in collaboration with Angeline Meitzler, with frontend help from Janine Rosen and PDF support from Charles Broskoski. It gathers hundreds of examples of radical online activism from across the world between 1991–present. I'm continuing to work on this project at Pioneer Works, in preparation of its printed publication Cyberfeminism Catalog</p>

      <p>The website Cyberfeminism Index was commissioned by Rhizome and then <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/first-look-cyberfeminism-index">premiered at the New Museum</a>. In regards to online exhibitions, Olia Lialina said, &quot;All you need is a link.&quot;</p>

      <p>Later, <a href="https://walkerart.org/magazine/sharing-as-survival-mindy-seu-cyberfeminism-index">I spoke with Marie Hoejlund</a> at the Walker Art Center to discuss the design and contents of Cyberfeminism Index and the politics of citation.</p>

      <p>For the majority of the pandemic, I co-curated the <a href="https://scalabilityproject.org/">Scalability Project</a> with Roxana Fabius and Patricia M. Hernandez for A.I.R. Gallery.</p>

      <p>Commissioned by MIT Media Lab's Poetic Justice group, I developed the second iteration of <a href="https://print.are.na/">print.are.na</a> with Charles Broskoski and Ekene Ijeoma. The tool allows you to plug in an Are.na channel and print it out as a book using Lulu.</p>

      <p>For Southland Institute, Laura Coombs and I led <a href="https://multidimensional.link/">a workshop about the asterisk</a> to create a collective, online publication.</p>

      <p>For the Knight Foundation, I wrote <a href="https://www.shiftspace.pub/on-gathering-mindy-seu">&quot;On Gathering&quot;</a> to think about multi-authored storytelling, building collections for intimate communities, and sharing through virtual events. This paper was edited by Salome Asega.</p>

      <p>The topic of my latest studio course at Yale School of Art was also called <a href="http://on-gathering.com/">&quot;On Gathering&quot;</a>, where students developed two projects about the material and social forms of gathering through an online collection and a virtual event.</p>

  <div class="card response" id="4"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q4"><h2 class="heading">How would you describe your approach to design and/or teaching?</h2></a>
      <p>Teaching is very cyclical. I like to think of myself as a facilitator, and I learn so much from the students. Not only do they introduce me to new things, these classes almost feel like a form of research and development where I'm able to work through my own interests with a group of people.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card response" id="5"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q5"><h2 class="heading">What are you currently thinking about or excited about in interactive or graphic design?</h2></a>
      <p>I'm fascinated by the translation between digital and physical, like exhibitions with a digital overlay or print-on-demand. I also think it's important to think about sustainability through low-tech, solar-powered websites, lightweight websites, e-waste, etc.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card response" id="6"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q6"><h2 class="heading">Who is one of your design influences (or a designer you’d recommend the students look into)?</h2></a>
      <p>I often refer to the work of Muriel Cooper, who led the Visible Language workshop at MIT Media Lab. → <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn9zCrIJzLs">Information Landscapes</a></p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card response" id="7"><div class="content"><a href="/questions/q7"><h2 class="heading">What is your studio and working setup?</h2></a>
      <p>I'm currently a technology resident at Pioneer Works, an arts organization in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. I bike here in the mornings from Brooklyn Heights and work in a multi-person studio — with masks!</p>
