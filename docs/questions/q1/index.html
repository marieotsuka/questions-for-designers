      <p>Our members have been cross-disciplinary overall due to our background in BFA<sup>1</sup>. Taehee specifically got interested in design due to their personal interest in socially engaged art practice as an undergraduate student since so much of the art work utilized the design knowledge to be accessible to the public.</p>

      <p>I began using the Internet at a really young age — probably 6 or 7 years old. By the time I was in middle school, I was active on message boards and forums, and I created a few of my own. I designed merch, websites, blogs, and other things around that time, too. I didn’t really call what I was doing “graphic design,” and I didn’t even think of pursuing a career in graphic design after high school. Once I was in college, though, a few of my friends asked me to design flyers for their events, which eventually led to me working as a designer at UChicago’s International House. By the time I graduated, I knew that I wanted to study graphic design. I went to MICA and then Cranbrook, and I began piecing together my practice after that.</p>
