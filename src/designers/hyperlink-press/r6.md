There are so many, but [Studio REV](https://www.studiorev.org/)- does a great project that uplifts domestic and immigrant workers. [Endless Editions](http://www.endlesseditions.com/) has been a great friend of ours, without whom we would have been able to start our zine practice. [Radix Media](https://radixmedia.org/) is also amazing, which is a workers owned print shop based in Brooklyn, NY.
