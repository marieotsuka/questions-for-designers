I think I've learned that even if I wasn't aware there was a throughline in my practice, as you continue to make things, connections and associations emerge. When I was working at 2x4 in San Francisco / NYC, I was also working on my personal projects about online collections and workshops for handmade websites. This practice eventually became more charged as I began to think about the politics of collections, histories, and archives.
