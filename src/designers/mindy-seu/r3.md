I recently made the [Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/) in collaboration with Angeline Meitzler, with frontend help from Janine Rosen and PDF support from Charles Broskoski. It gathers hundreds of examples of radical online activism from across the world between 1991–present. I'm continuing to work on this project at Pioneer Works, in preparation of its printed publication Cyberfeminism Catalog
