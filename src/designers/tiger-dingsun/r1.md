I began using the Internet at a really young age — probably 6 or 7 years old. By the time I was in middle school, I was active on message boards and forums, and I created a few of my own. I designed merch, websites, blogs, and other things around that time, too. I didn’t really call what I was doing “graphic design,” and I didn’t even think of pursuing a career in graphic design after high school. Once I was in college, though, a few of my friends asked me to design flyers for their events, which eventually led to me working as a designer at UChicago’s International House. By the time I graduated, I knew that I wanted to study graphic design. I went to MICA and then Cranbrook, and I began piecing together my practice after that.
