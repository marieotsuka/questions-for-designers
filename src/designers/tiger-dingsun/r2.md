Same as how I got started as a graphic designer. I began using the Internet at age 6 or 7, and I used the rudimentary website builders and design tools when I was participating in and running my own forums. I donâ€™t consider myself an interactive designer, but I definitely think my understanding of typography, text, and language are informed by my experiences on the web.
